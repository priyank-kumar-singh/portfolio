# Portfolio
This is the starting of the portfolio application.

## Test Locally
I have used only [flutter_gen](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gen) package as an additional dependency which may require you to setup some things. This package generates assets, so I won't make any mistakes typing their absolute paths to the assets directory. Its pretty easy to install [flutter_gen](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gen) package, just follow their installation docs.

Environment Details-
1. Windows 11
2. SDK '>=2.16.0-134.5.beta <3.0.0'
3. Flutter version 2.11.0-0.1.pre
4. Dart version 2.17.0 (build 2.17.0-69.2.beta)

If you're adding new assets you may want to generate Assets class for those assets like I did with flutter_gen package, just run following command from the root directory of the application.
```
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```
